			<p id="intro">Hyperactive copywriter and graphic designer</p>
		<div id="copy"><h1 id="firsth1">Who I Am</h1>
			<p id="firstline">I’m Eric Baxter Higgins. Grew up in Portage, MI. Finishing my BA in Advertising and specialization in design this summer.</p>
			<p>Copywriting is my passion. I love the impact of thoughtful headlines, and themelines. I like the wit, humor, sarcasm, etc. of the conversational writing style. You might notice that I write with lots of en dashes – in my mind it’s the best punctuation character in written language (nerdy yes, but I don’t care.)</p>
			<p>I like graphic design and web design as well, and seek to continuously improve my knowledge of these subjects. I’m constantly coming up with new ideas across different media, and I understand the synergy of writing copy and thinking visually when developing anything from a print advertisement to a multi-page website.</p>

		<h1>My Hardware</h1>		
			<p id="firstline">I mainly work on my 15” MacBook Pro. I’ve had it for about 3 years now and haven’t had a single problem with it. 
			<p>I’m considering adding a second monitor for more work space – and so I don’t have to constantly flip through applications to find the perfect song for my work mood or <a href="http://i.imgur.com/aywssQ8.gif">watch something ridiculous</a>
			<p>I use my iPhone 4S mainly for self-organization, photography, social media, and sports. I have serious appreciation for apps with intuitive user interfaces.</p>
		<h1>My Software</h1>
			<p id="firstline">I just upgraded to OS X Maverick – don’t know why I waited until now, but am starting to explore what’s new with it. Can’t see myself ever going back to a PC, I love the software’s simplicity. 			<p>I used Dreamweaver in my previous experience writing HMTL5 and CSS code. I downloaded TextMate to use for a text editor, so I’ll see how I like it (this page is my first time using it).
			<p>I store my photography in iPhoto since it conveniently links up with an iPhone’s photo stream. From there I pull photos that I consider using in a specific project into Photoshop to play around with them. I also keep tons of photos for inspiration – cool typography, art styles, ad campaign executions, anything to serve as brain fuel for my own concepts and pieces.
			<p>I listen to all my music on Spotify. I like the ease of sharing new music with a few of my buddies. Lately I’ve been going between classic rock and electronic – an odd combination I know. I use iTunes to occasionally purhcase a song that I can’t live without.
				
		<h1>My Dream Setup</h1>		
			<p id="firstline">While I don’t own a tablet, I dream of being able to carry around an all-in-one 8.5” x 11” tablet – one that runs and edits any type of file from a one-page word document to a multi-page Illustrator file. 
			<p>It’d have a wireless mouse as well as a pen stylus for drawing or taking handwritten notes – for some things I like handwritten notes, while for others I find a Word notebook doc more convenient.
			<p>And an external hard drive with over a terabyte of storage and automatic VCS functionality. I hate the process of transferring files between my flash drive and multiple computers. After working on another computer, I sometimes forget to transfer updates back to my computer – I suppose I’m at fault for not always renaming new file versions, but it’d be great not having to think about that.</p>

		<h1>Hobbies & Interests</h1>
			<p id="firstline">I ski as much as possible. I usually go to Jackson Hole, Wyoming for a week each year with my family. I ride a pair of Salmon 1080s, but like demoing something really fat for heavy powder days.
			<p>I try to stay relatively active. I like to bike, play tennis, swim and kayak.
			<p>I love dogs. We have 2 at my parents house, Emily and Annie (our dogs always have people names). They’re overflowing with personality – and they’re the only alarm clock I’ve ever liked. 
			<p>I draw. It’s been one of my favorite hobbies for as long as I can remember. My favorite mediums are graphite and acrylic paint. Just bought a set of watercolor pencils so can’t wait to try those out.
			<p>I love typography – I downloaded 12 typefaces just yesterday. I was pumped to find the font used in <a href="http://www.gtaunderground.com/index.php?act=Vice%20City/Vice%20City%20Fonts">Grand Theft Auto Vice City</a>
			<p>I play video games when I have a little free time mainly on Playstation 3, however; I occasionally game on Xbox 360 and my N64 – it's classic.</p></div>
